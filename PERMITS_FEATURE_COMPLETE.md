## 🗄️ Database Models

### Permit Model

```python
class Permit(models.Model):
    name                  # Permit name/type
    number                # Unique permit number
    issue_date            # When permit was issued
    expiry_date           # When permit expires
    issued_by             # Issuing authority
    is_active             # Active status (superseded permits = False)
    parent_permit         # Link to original permit (for renewals)
    renewal_url           # External renewal URL
    document              # Uploaded permit file
    facility              # Foreign key to Location
    uploaded_by           # Foreign key to User
    created_at            # Timestamp
    updated_at            # Timestamp
```

### PermitHistory Model

```python
class PermitHistory(models.Model):
    permit                # Foreign key to Permit
    action                # Description of action
    user                  # Foreign key to User
    notes                 # Additional details
    document_url          # Related document URL
    created_at            # Timestamp
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. AI-Powered Document Extraction

When a permit document is uploaded, the system automatically extracts:
- Permit name/type
- Permit number
- Issue date
- Expiry date
- Issuing authority

**Note:** Current implementation uses a mock extraction function. To integrate real AI:

```python
# In permits/views.py - extract_permit_data() method
# Replace the mock implementation with:

import openai  # or your preferred AI service

def extract_permit_data(self, file):
    # Read file content
    file_content = file.read()

    # Call AI service (example with OpenAI)
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Extract permit information from this document: {file_content}"
        }]
    )

    # Parse AI response and return structured data
    return parsed_data
```

### 2. Permit Status Calculation

Permits are automatically categorized:
- **Active:** More than 30 days until expiry
- **Expiring Soon:** 30 days or less until expiry
- **Expired:** Past expiry date
- **Superseded:** Marked inactive (replaced by renewal)

### 3. Permit Versioning

When a permit is renewed:
1. Original permit is marked `is_active = False`
2. New permit is created with `parent_permit` pointing to original
3. History entries are created for both permits
4. Original remains in system for audit trail

### 4. Conditional UI Actions

Permit cards show different actions based on status:
- **Download:** Available if document exists
- **View History:** Always available
- **Renew Online:** Available if `renewal_url` exists and permit is expiring/expired
- **Upload Renewal:** Available if permit is expiring/expired

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies (if needed)

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pip install djangorestframework pillow

# Frontend (already has dependencies)
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Run Migrations

```bash
cd backend
python manage.py makemigrations permits
python manage.py migrate
```

### 3. Create Superuser (if needed)

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 4. Configure Media Files

Ensure `settings.py` has media file configuration:

```python
# settings.py
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
```

Add to main `urls.py`:

```python
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

### 5. Add Permissions

Add the `view_permits` permission to your permissions system:

```bash
python manage.py shell
```

```python
from permissions.models import Permission, RolePermission

# Create view_permits permission
perm = Permission.objects.create(
    name='view_permits',
    codename='view_permits',
    description='Can view permits and licenses',
    category='Permits'
)

# Assign to roles (example: admin and contributor)
RolePermission.objects.create(
    role='admin',
    permission=perm,
    is_granted=True
)

RolePermission.objects.create(
    role='contributor',
    permission=perm,
    is_granted=True
)
```

### 6. Start Development Servers

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python manage.py runserver

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

2. Click "Add New Permit"
3. Drag and drop a PDF file
4. Click Upload
5. Verify permit appears in list with extracted data

### Test Renewal Flow

1. Find an expiring or expired permit
2. Click "Upload Renewal"
3. Upload renewal document
4. Verify:
   - New permit created
   - Original permit marked as superseded
   - History shows renewal action
   - Both permits have history entries

### Test History View

1. Click "View History" on any permit
2. Verify history modal shows:
   - All actions in chronological order
   - User who performed each action
   - Dates and timestamps
   - Document links (if applicable)

### Test Filtering

1. Click each filter tab
2. Verify permits are filtered correctly:

## 📊 Database Queries

### Get Permits for Facility

```sql
SELECT * FROM permits_permit
WHERE facility_id = 1
AND is_active = true
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Get Expiring Permits

```sql
SELECT * FROM permits_permit
WHERE expiry_date <= CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '30 days'
AND expiry_date > CURRENT_DATE
AND is_active = true;
```

### Get Permit Chain (Original + Renewals)

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE permit_chain AS (
  SELECT * FROM permits_permit WHERE id = 1
  UNION ALL
  SELECT p.* FROM permits_permit p
  INNER JOIN permit_chain pc ON p.parent_permit_id = pc.id
)
SELECT * FROM permit_chain ORDER BY created_at;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No permits found"

**Solution:**
1. Check if facility is selected
2. Verify permits exist in database
3. Check API endpoint returns data: `/api/permits/`
4. Review browser console for errors

### Issue: "Upload failed"

**Solution:**
1. Check file size (must be < 10MB)
2. Verify file format (PDF, JPG, PNG only)
3. Ensure media directory is writable
4. Check backend logs for errors

### Issue: "Permits menu item not showing"

**Solution:**
1. Verify user has `view_permits` permission
2. Check permissions in database
3. Clear browser cache and reload
4. Verify permissions system is working

### Issue: "AI extraction returns placeholder data"

**Solution:**
The current implementation uses mock data. To enable real AI extraction:
1. Integrate with OpenAI/Anthropic/other AI service
2. Update `extract_permit_data()` in `permits/views.py`
3. Add API keys to environment variables
4. Install required AI SDK packages
